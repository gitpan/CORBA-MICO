CORBA Control Center
=================

CORBA Control Center (CCC) is a tool providing user interface for
standard CORBA subsystems and services.

Status
======
Only one part of CCC implemented: Interface repository browser.
Supports the following features:
  1. Representing Interface Repository as a tree, navigating through it.
  2. Reconstruction of source IDL code for IR entities.
  3. Simple graphical representation of ancestor-successor relationships for 
     IDL interfaces.
  4. Inheritance trees may be exported to files in format understandable
     by DIA (http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia/dia.html). 
  5. Representing Name Service as a tree, navigating through it.
   
Requirements
============
CORBA::MICO (version 0.6.2 or later)
Gtk module for Perl (version 0.7006 or later)

Installation
============
To install and run this program, you'll need to have CORBA::MICO v0.6.2
or better and Gtk/Perl v0.7006 or better installed.

To build this package type:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make

The package then can be installed by executing the command:

  make install

Running
=======
To run CCC you have to have:
  - MICO Interface Repository running and accessible from your system.
  - Interface Repository IDL files fed to Interface Repository.
  - Name service server running and accessible from your system (optional).
  - Name Service IDL file (CosNaming.idl) fed to Interface Repository (optional)
Then type:
   $ ccc -ORBIfaceRepoAddr <IR-address> [-ORBNamingAddr <NSD-address>] &
       where <IR-address>  is Interface Repository address
             <NSD-address> is Name Service server address
or simply
   $ ccc
if you have .micorc file in your home directory containing Interface Repository
and Name Service server (if you want Name Service to be managed from within CCC)addresses.

File start-servers.sh in CORBA::MICO package may be used for starting 
and preparing Interface Repository and .micorc file.

To run Name Service server you should type
  $ nsd -ORBIIOPAddr <NSD-address> &
    where <NSD-address> is base server address in format inet:<hostname>:<port>
Than you may use MICO naming service administration tool (nsadmin) 
to add/edir/remove Name Service entries.
The following command may be used to feed Name Service IDL file to IR.  
  $ idl --no-codegen-c++ --feed-ir CosNaming.idl 
   
Troubleshooting
===============
The most popular diagnostic messages and probable problems may cause them:

1.
warning: cannot bind to Interface Repository at ...
warning: will use a local Interface Repository
Cannot find 'IDL:omg.org/CORBA:1.0' in interface repository at ...
...

Most probable reasons: 
  - IR is not running or accessible
  - bad IR address (option -ORBIfaceRepoAddr) or $HOME/.micorc file.

2.
Cannot find 'IDL:omg.org/CORBA:1.0' in interface repository at ...
...

Most probable reasons: 
  - There is no IR address (option -ORBIfaceRepoAddr) or $HOME/.micorc file
  - Interface Repository IDL files were not fed to Interface Repository.
  
3.
Name Service will not be supported so as module CosNaming was not found in IR
Reason:
  - There is Name Service server running and acceptable but its IDL 
    file (CosNaming.idl) was not fed to Interface Repository.
