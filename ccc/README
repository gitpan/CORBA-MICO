CORBA Control Center
=================

CORBA Control Center (CCC) is a tool providing user interface for
standard CORBA subsystems and services.

Status
======
Only one part of CCC implemented: Interface repository browser.
Supports the following features:
  1. Representing Interface Repository as a tree, navigating through it.
  2. Reconstruction of source IDL code for IR entities.
  3. Simple graphical representation of ancestor-successor relationships for 
     IDL interfaces.
  4. Inheritance trees may be exported to files in format understandable
     by DIA (http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia/dia.html). 
   
Requirements
============
CORBA::MICO (version 0.6.2 or later)
Gtk module for Perl (version 0.7006 or later)

Installation
============
To install and run this program, you'll need to have CORBA::MICO v0.6.2
or better and Gtk/Perl v0.7006 or better installed.

To build this package type:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make

The package then can be installed by executing the command:

  make install

Running
=======
To run CCC you have to have:
  - MICO Interface Repository running and accessible from your system.
  - Interface Repository IDL files fed to Interface Repository.
Then type:
   $ ccc -ORBIfaceRepoAddr <IR-address> &
or simply
   $ ccc
if you have .micorc file in your home directory containing Interface Repository
address.

File start-servers.sh in CORBA::MICO package may be used for starting 
and preparing Interface Repository and .micorc file.
   
Troubleshooting
===============
The most popular diagnostic messages and probable problems may cause them:

1.
warning: cannot bind to Interface Repository at ...
warning: will use a local Interface Repository
Cannot find 'IDL:omg.org/CORBA:1.0' in interface repository at ...
...

Most probable reasons: 
  - IR is not running or accessible
  - bad IR address (option -ORBIfaceRepoAddr) or $HOME/.micorc file.

2.
Cannot find 'IDL:omg.org/CORBA:1.0' in interface repository at ...
...

Most probable reasons: 
  - There is no IR address (option -ORBIfaceRepoAddr) or $HOME/.micorc file
  - Interface Repository IDL files were not fed to Interface Repository.
