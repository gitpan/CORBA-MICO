- Check results of all calls to pmico_to_any, provide useful
  error messages.

- Cache results in hash table when looking up descriptions on the
  server side to avoid tons of strcmp's.

- Implement constants. (Probably use newCONSTSUB from IO.xs)
  This also means generalizing loading (preload()) to load
  not just interfaces but general containers)

- Set up Typecode constants for loaded interfaces/modules.

- Fill in member functions for TypeCode

- Globally remove all the damn (char *) casts when passing const
  char *'s into Perl functions and do something better.

- The conversions functions in exttypes.cc are pretty cheesy.
  They should use C library functions when available. (In particular
  for LongDouble, where the last bit tends to be wrong)

- Optimize CORBA::MICO::Fixed.

- A test suite.

- Create the temporary files for the examples in /tmp
