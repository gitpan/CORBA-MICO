This directory contains a more substantial example
of the use of CORBA::MICO - an interface repostory
browser.

It requires the Gtk module for Perl and gtk+.

To run it, run start-servers.sh in the parent
directory, then in this directory, run:

 perl -Mblib ./browser 

The implementation and user interface here
are far from complete.
