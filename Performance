Some notes about performance:

* -Mblib is expensive (~0.4) seconds. Don't be fooled.

* Startup time is the big bottleneck.

  Rough breakdown of timings of 'client'

  Time to start perl, ~0.1 sec
  Time to load standard Perl libraries ~0.5 sec
  Time to bootstrap MICO ~0.4

  Total user time 1.25 seconds

* Clearly, the thing that would make the most difference would
  be speeding up the bootstrap process. It's not quite clear
  why it takes that long, but for one thing, initializing 
  typecodes and exceptions takes 0.15 seconds, so perhaps
  that could be delayed and done on demand.
